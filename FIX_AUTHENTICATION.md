# Authentication Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue Identified
The login was failing because of a **salt mismatch** between:
- `AuthManager.SALT = "ims_secure_salt_2025"` (used for login verification)
- `_seed_admin_user()` using `"default_salt"` (used when creating admin)

This caused the password hashes to never match, making login impossible.

## Fix Applied
Updated `src/storage.py` line 140:
```python
# Before:
salt = "default_salt"

# After:
salt = "ims_secure_salt_2025"  # Must match AuthManager.SALT
```

## Verification
âœ… Database recreated with correct password hash
âœ… Login test passed: `admin` / `admin123` works correctly
âœ… CLI application running without errors
âœ… All 7 database tables initialized
âœ… Admin user seeded successfully

## You Can Now Use The Application
```powershell
python src/cli.py
```

Login with:
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123

All features are now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
